# myrecipe
My recipe's store

This is an online store to keep track, create, read (open), modify (edit) and delete of recipes, also it was made in NodeJs, Angular with the help of it's RestFul API pointing to "/api/recipe" and a server support from my own data store on MongoDB Atlas!...

If you cloned this app, the frontend file can be ran on localhost:4200, and backend file can run on your on custom localhost support which you can change in the following path "backend/server.js", changing it's PORT.

Also the frontend app can be cloned from https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-go-fullstack-recipe-frontend.git

This app needs to have the root paths as followed.

myrecipe --- backend, frontend.

backend --- https://github.com/Stanyke/myrecipe/tree/master/backend (All the files & the folder in this tree).

frontend --- https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-go-fullstack-recipe-frontend (All the files & the folder in this tree).



Hope you Enjoy and learn from this web application.
