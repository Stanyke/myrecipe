# myrecipe
My recipe's store

This is an online store to keep track of recipes/anything, alos it was made in NodeJs, Angular with the help of it's RestFul API pointing to "/api/recipe" and a server support from my own data store on MongoDB Atlas!...

If you cloned this app, the frontend file can be ran on localhost:4200, and backend file can run on your on custom localhost support which you can change in the following path "backend/server.js", changing it's PORT.

Hope you Enjoy and learn from this web application.
